language files

If you want to translate ArduinoBlocks to your language, get "en.json" (English) raname it to your language code (maintaining ".json" as the file extension) edit the content with a plain text editor (change all the english strings to your language) and upload the new file to the repository or send it to info@arduinoblocks.com

Thanks!
